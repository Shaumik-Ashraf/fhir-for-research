We use the [RStudio Visual R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/) interchangeably with writing raw Markdown in another editor like VSCode. Visual R Markdown will automatically reformat `.md` or `.qmd` files when opening them, so we do not get hung up on specific Markdown styling as we accept the default output of Visual R Markdown.

The following are style rules that are not impacted by Visual R Markdown automatic reformatting.

Visual R Markdown uses [Pandoc's flavor of Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) so that's what we use when manually writing Markdown. [Quarto's Markdown guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) is also helpful.

If you write Markdown by hand, you should run it through the Pandoc Markdown formatter by toggling the RStudio Visual R Markdown mode on and off. This will avoid trivial changes showing up in git commits if subsequent authors edit your file with Visual R Markdown.

## Headings

-   Headings in `.qmd` files should start at `<h2>` (i.e., `##` in Markdown). The `title` element of the front matter at the top of each `.qmd` file is automatically inserted as the `<h1>` for the page.
-   The contents of heading tags, excluding the page titles, should be `Sentence case` (the first letter is capitalized), **not** Title Case. Page titles should be Title Case.
-   Headings should not be numbered manually -- this happens automatically.

## Frontmatter

Each module needs frontmatter like the following:

    ---
    title: FHIR From 1,000 Feet

    area:
      name: Overview
    topic:
      name: FHIR for Research

    roles:
      - Informaticist
      - Software Engineer

    learning_objectives:
      - question: "How does hand-written Markdown interact with Markdown generated by RStudio's Visual R Markdown mode?"
        answer: "We rely on Visual R Markdown to generate the finalized Markdown styling for pages on this website. If you are writing Markdown by hand, you should run it through Visual R Markdown before committing."
      - question: "What are the key stylistic concerns for writing FHIR for Research content?"
        answer: "Key stylistic concerns include capitalization of titles and headings, proper citations and alt text on images, and consistent referencing of FHIR resources and the FHIR specification."
      - question: "What are the standardized ways to reference FHIR resources and the FHIR specification?"
        answer: "Resources should appear like [`Patient`](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html). Links to the FHIR spec should point to a specific version when used as the source for a quote or other content that may change between versions. FHIR "Resource Content" tables and the analogous tables from profiles may appear as screenshots."

### Title

Use [this website](https://individed.com/code/to-title-case/) to properly capitalize titles.

### Area and topic

The `area` and `topic` properties are used to create the "breadcrumb" above the title on module pages.

### Targeted roles

Roles should be listed as a YAML array in the frontmatter. The following roles are valid, and should appear verbatim as below:

    - Investigator
    - Research Leaders
    - Informaticist
    - Software Engineer
    - Clinician Scientist/Trainee

## Voice

See [Microsoft's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/grammar/person) and [Google's](https://developers.google.com/style/person) style guides for examples of using first person, second person, and imperative voice in writing.

### First person

Avoid singular first person pronouns ("I"/"me").

Use plural first person sparingly ("we"/"us") to refer to the authors.

Never use the global "we": "We need to solve world-hunger."

### Second person

Write as though you are speaking to the reader and use second person "you." Avoid using phrases like, "the reader."

### Imperative

When providing instructions, use imperative voice where possible.

From [Microsoft's style guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/grammar/person):

> Change your password (Instead of *We recommend that you change your password.*)
>
> That didn't work. Try again. (Instead of *We weren't able to run the Solution Checker. Try running it again.*)

## Structure

### Learning objectives

At the top of each module, there should be a learning objectives call-out box that looks like the following:

::: callout-tip
## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:

1.  How does hand-written Markdown interact with Markdown generated by RStudio's Visual R Markdown mode?
2.  What are the key stylistic concerns for writing FHIR for Research content?
3.  What are the standardized ways to reference FHIR resources and the FHIR specification?
:::

### Key points

At the bottom of the module,

## Quotes

Quotes or excerpts longer than a sentence should be in `<blockquote>` tags (in Markdown, each line is prefixed with `>`) like this:

> This is a blockquote. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

## Code

Use fences like this:

    ```json
    {
        "some json": "goes here"
    }
    ```

This will provide syntax highlighting for the indicated language, like this:

``` json
{
    "some json": "goes here"
}
```

## Links

From the [Google documentation guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html):

> Markdown link syntax allows you to set a link title, just as HTML does. Use it wisely.
>
> Titling your links as "link" or "here" tells the reader precisely nothing when quickly scanning your doc and is a waste of space:
>
>     See the syntax guide for more info: [link](syntax_guide.md).
>     Or, check out the style guide [here](style_guide.md).
>     DO NOT DO THIS.
>
> Instead, write the sentence naturally, then go back and wrap the most appropriate phrase with the link:
>
>     See the [syntax guide](syntax_guide.md) for more info.
>     Or, check out the [style guide](style_guide.md).

## Citing

When citing web-based content, simply add a hyperlink as described above.

When citing printed content or any content where an academic reader would expect a formal citation, use Quarto's built-in [citation capabilities](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html). References should be added to `references.bib` in the root of the repository.

## Images

Images should link the source (or include a proper citation if it's from an "academic" source) and alt text, like this:

![An example caption for an image. Photo by [Andriyko Podilnyk](https://unsplash.com/@andriyko) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/RCfi7vgJjUY).](images/kitten-unsplash.jpg){fig-alt="A kitten walking in a field of green grass."}

In the source code, this looks like:

``` markdown
![An example caption for an image. Photo by [Andriyko Podilnyk](https://unsplash.com/@andriyko) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/RCfi7vgJjUY).](images/kitten-unsplash.jpg){fig-alt="A kitten walking in a field of green grass."}
```

This is rendered to HTML as:

``` html
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
   <figure class="figure">
      <p><img src="images/kitten-unsplash.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A kitten walking in a field of green grass."></p>
      <p></p>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">An example caption for an image. Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@andriyko">Andriyko Podilnyk</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/RCfi7vgJjUY">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption>
      <p></p>
   </figure>
</div>
```

Note the `<img>` tag in the rendered HTML has an `alt` property. This is critical for accessibility, and all images **must** have this.

## Referencing FHIR artifacts

-   [FHIR resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) should be referred to as "FHIR resources", not "Resources" or "resources" to avoid confusion with other kinds of resources.

-   <mark>Specific FHIR resources should be referred to like "[`Patient`](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html)," and hyperlinked to the relevant FHIR spec page the **first** time they appear</mark> (or again if you think it's likely the reader will want to refer to the FHIR spec, like if you are introducing a screenshot of the "Resource Content" spec table, it is probably helpful to link back to the FHIR resource's page in the spec).\
    \
    This mirrors the capitalization that appears on the [FHIR resources list](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html).\
    \
    Once you have linked to the FHIR spec's resource page for the first time, refer to the resource like: `Patient`.

-   Reference to specific elements should be in backticks like `` `Patient.name` `` when referencing the "name" element in `Patient`. Use the full element path including the resource name unless it's too unwieldy/repetitive.

    -   Don't hyperlink `Patient.name` directly, but if it's useful to link to the element details, you can do it like so:\
        \
        The `Patient.name` element ([details here](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient-definitions.html#Patient.name)) stores one or more names associated with an individual.

-   Links to the FHIR spec should be...

    -   ...to the current version (`https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html`) if you are generally referring to something in the spec in a way that is version-independent.

    -   ...to a specific version if you are referring to something specific -- like a specific element or quoting the spec -- that could change over time you should link to a specific version (`https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/patient.html`)

        -   A heuristic for this: if you think the link might be broken in a future FHIR release, use a release-specific link.

        -   Likewise, if you refer to content that might change (even if the link still resolves), use a release-specific link.

        -   If we want to "upgrade" the documentation in the future, we can search for all instances of `https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/`, and then check those links for

## Referencing the FHIR specification

For narrative content, use long block quotes with a link in the preceding sentence.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Example of citing the FHIR spec

The [FHIR specification notes that it can be difficult to know where to start](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/modules.html):

> FHIR is a platform specification that defines a set of capabilities used across the healthcare process, in all jurisdictions, and in lots of different contexts. While the basics of the FHIR specification are relatively straight-forward (see the Overviews: [General](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/overview.html), [Developers](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/overview-dev.html), [Clinical](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/overview-clinical.html), and [Architects](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/overview-arch.html)), it can still be difficult to know where to start when implementing a solution based on FHIR.
:::

Note that this links to a specific version of FHIR (`https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/modules.html`) as it is a direct quote.

Also note that the hyperlinks in the excerpt are maintained in the blockquote. The easiest way to accomplish this is to copy from the FHIR spec and directly paste into the `.qmd` file.

We will often refer to the "Resource Content"/"Profile Content" table for a FHIR resource or profile. This should be implemented as a single screenshot taken on a high DPI screen (like a MacBook screen) at 100% browser zoom for each table.

Screenshots of profiles' tables should include the tabs at the top to identify which view of the table is being displayed. The screenshot should be introduced with a link to the profile in question, like below.

For example, here is the differential from [the Device Metric Observation Profile R4B](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/devicemetricobservation.html):

[![](images/image-1899311563.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the profile definition table in the Device Metric Observation Profile in FHIR R4B."}](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/devicemetricobservation.html#profile)

Captions are not necessary for these screenshots. However, the images still need `alt` text and should link to the page where the screenshot was taken. Version-specific links should be used.

The same approach should be used for these tables in FHIR resources, though it is not necessary to include the tabs.

Here's a screenshot from the [Observation resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/observation.html) as an example:

[![](images/observation.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the resource content table for the FHIR Observation resource."}](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4Bobservation.html#resource)

Note that the image hyperlink includes the `#resource` anchor to bring the reader directly to the "Resource Content" table in the documentation.

It is ok to only include part of these tables in the screenshot if that is beneficial. The example from Observation above is quite long, and it might be helpful to crop unnecessary parts. If you do this, you should do some lightweight image editing like so:

[![](images/image-1375861502.png){fig-alt="Excerpt from the resource contents table for the FHIR Observation resource."}](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/observation.html#resource)

If we do this frequently, we can look into standardizing how this is done for consistency.
