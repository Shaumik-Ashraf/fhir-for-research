  - question: Why are Common Data Models necessary in healthcare?
    answer: Observational data in healthcare settings comes from many disparate sources and requires harmonization into a standard structure.
  - question: How do Common Data Models help researchers?
    answer: Faciliting research is one of the major function of Common Data Models in healthcare, since they provide researchers an organized and standardized environment to pull data.
  - question: How does FHIR help researchers work with Common Data Models?
    answer: The Common Data Models Harmonization (CDMH) FHIR Implementation Guide maps observational data between common CDMs, allowing researchers to harmonize data from multiple health systems that might use different CDMs.

Common Data Models (CDMs) are a critical component for interoperability across health organizations and a researcher's ability to query relevant batches of data.

## Definitions

Common Data Model

:   Set of standardized data schemas that allow data to be organized and shared across different applications. [@pcornet]

    In healthcare, CDMs provide a standard structure to organize data between different sources in the same health system as well as between different health organizations.

Shared Health Data Network (SHDN)

:   Network of organizations that establish a common CDM. An SHDN can make data available to researchers in three major ways: [@cdm_timeline_paper]

    -   **Pooled SHDN** - Data is centralized into a single location where researchers can access it in a client/server relationship.

    -   **Federated SHDN** - Data is stored at individual source organizations but a centralized clearinghouse exists for remote querying of collective data batches.

    -   **Hybrid SHDN** - Functionally the same as Federated SHDNs from the researcher's perspective, but some data batches are pooled from multiple organizations while others are single-organization only.

Distributed Health Data Network (DHDN)

:   Type of SDHN where data is available to remote users via a query interface as opposed to onsite only like the examples above. [@dhdn]

## The importance of CDMs in research

### The problem

Observational data in healthcare is complex and comes from disparate data sources. There are three major purposes for collecting and storing such data: [@book_of_ohdsi]

| Reason to Collect Observational Healthcare Data | Common Data Source      |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Facilitate research                             | Survey or registry data |
| Support conduct of healthcare                   | EHR data                |
| Manage healthcare payments                      | Claims                  |

Researchers often need to pull data from all sources listed above, as well as requiring large numbers of observed patients to draw conclusions with appropriate statistical power. If each source has different formatting and structural schemas, a simple query can turn into a larger data pipeline problem. On top of that, strict data use agreements and complex access control for individual data sources provide additional roadblocks.

### The solution

This is where a CDM is useful, as it allows researchers to query data batches with methods that can be "systematically applied to produce meaningfully comparable and reproducible results." [@book_of_ohdsi] A CDM can be thought of as the "middleman" that organizes disparate data sources within a healthcare organization in a structured way so that researchers can focus on analytics instead of complex data ingestion. Researchers no longer need to worry about individual data source connection, formatting, or protection issues.

## Commons CDMs

The following are some of the most commonly used CDMs in the US for research purposes:

-   [Sentinel](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/)

-   [PCORnet (Patient-Centered Outcomes Researcher Network)](https://pcornet.org/)

-   [i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside)](https://www.i2b2.org/about/index.html)

-   [OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership)](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/)

### Sentinel

Launched by the FDA in 2007, Sentinel's main purpose is to monitor drug safety. It has a DHDN model for its CDM and functions as the FDA's national electronic system. [@cdm_timeline_paper]

Its CDM is organized into the following major schemas: [@sentinel]

-   Administrative Data (enrollment, demographic, dispensing, encounter, diagnosis, procedure, prescribing)

-   Mother-Infant Linkage Data

-   Auxilary Data (facility, provider)

-   Registry Data (death, cause of death, state vaccine)

-   Inpatient Data (inpatient pharmacy, inpatient transfusion)

-   Clinical Data (lab result, vital signs)

-   Patient-Reported Measures (PRM) Data (PRM survey, PRM survey response)

For more information, please visit [Sentinel's CDM webpage](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/methods-data-tools/sentinel-common-data-model).

### PCORnet

Developed in 2014 by PCORI (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute), PCORnet is a DHDN that facilitates multi-site patient-centered research and allows participating organizations to maintain both physical and operational control over its data. It describes itself as a "network of networks" that partners clinical research networks, patient partners, and coordinating health centers to curate EHR data as a single coalition. [@pcor] Its network includes data from 66 million patients for observational studies.

Below is a visual of its CDM schema. For more information, please review the [PCORnet CDM specification](https://pcornet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PCORnet-Common-Data-Model-v60-2020_10_221.pdf).

### i2b2

Developed in 2004 by Partners HealthCare and Harvard Medical School, i2b2 is an open-source research data application framework that "provides clinical and translational investigators with the tools necessary to integrate medical record and clinical research in the genomics age." [@i2b2_wiki_intro] This CDM's main purpose is to help tranlsate genomic findings and hypotheses for researchers.

i2b2's CDM is different from the other listed in that it does not have a separate database table for each data type. Its CDM is based on a "star schema" where all patient observations are stored in a single "fact" table that provides different codes for separate ontologies. There are three major upsides to this design choice: [@i2b2_wiki_intro]

-   Institutions can use their own local codes without the need to map to other data sets

-   Institutions can easily add new data types

-   Queries, analyses, and tools developed using i2b2 are future-proof since this CDM can remain stable over time

The visual below gives an example of this. The `observation_fact` table holds all observations that act as keys to connect to other tables that can be added by institutions with their own required data types.

For more information, please visit the [i2b2 CDM documentation](https://community.i2b2.org/wiki/display/BUN/i2b2+Common+Data+Model+Documentation).

### OMOP

OMOP was originally created in 2007 as a data warehouse to study the effects of medical products. [@cdm_timeline_paper] It is now managed by the OHDSI (Observational Health Data Science and Informatics) program and is an open source CDM designed to standardize observational data and enable efficient analysis in healthcare research settings. Below is a visual representation of the OMOP CDM: [@book_of_ohdsi]

![](images/image-1041728868.png)

A central component of OMOP are the [OHDSI standardized vocabularies](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/wiki), which allow the standardization of terms across various terminologies, such as the ones discussed in the [Terminology Introduction Module](modules/10-intro--terminology-introduction). Below is a great visual provided by OHDSI that shows how different domains of healthcare data can have a variety of terminologies all describing the same thing. [@ohdsi_vocab] Standardized vocabularies allow researchers to analyze data from many different terminologies in a simplified format.

## CDMs and FHIR

A problem arises when a researcher may want to aggregate data from multiple SHDNs that each use a different CDM. This is an issue well suited for FHIR to address, as its flexibility allows for such mappings to be developed. The [Common Data Models Harmonization FHIR Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cdmh/2019May/) has created mappings between each of the four CDMs discussed in the previous section.

Its infrastructure is "sustainable, flexible, and modifiable based on the research questions." [@onc_cdm_harmonization] It allows researchers to have even larger sample sizes as well as additional demographics, such as elderly, children, and non-U.S. population.

Below is an abstract model of the data flow from multiple SHDNs to an aggregated form ready for a researcher to query. [@cdmh_overview]
