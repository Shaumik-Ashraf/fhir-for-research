## Introduction

FHIR has been adopted in many clinical settings, but its utilization in research has been slower. There are several ways FHIR could be beneficial to research though, including data standardization and data sharing, researcher and participant communication, and institutional collaboration. 

## Research themes

A review of studies that use FHIR in their research, including a meta-analysis of papers on FHIR for research [@duda2022], found four themes that could be adapted to other health centers or projects:

<!--# DISCUSS: I don't feel great about the "themes" and organization of this because several overlap and the themes aren't really consistent in topic. But I'm struggling to think of an alternative. --KMB-->


### Data models and platforms

FHIR has been used in several studies to transform health data from different data models into an interoperable format. This is a common issue for studies or research that uses data from different sites, agencies, and sources.

<!--# DISCUSS: The CTR's in particular will be familiar with this information but thought it might be helpful framing and level-setting if they're not familiar --KMB-->

<!--# FIX: Note that this might have overlap with the CDMs & FHIR section. Please coordiante. --MM -->

Common Data Models (CDMs) and platforms that have been used with FHIR in research include:

-   [Observational Medical Outcomes partnership (OMOP)](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/), a CDM for standardizing both administrative and electronic health record (EHR). It was developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative, and has been used by researchers, healthcare workers, analysts, etc. There is an [OMOPonFHIR](https://omoponfhir.org) initiative led by Georgia Tech to map between OMOP and FHIR.

-   [PCORnet](https://pcornet.org/data/) is another CDM, containing clinical data, patient-reported outcomes, and payor data, with the intent to support multi-site research.

-   [openEHR](https://www.openehr.org/about_us) is an EHR platform that includes modeling tools and clinical knowledge management (CKM).

-   [Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)](https://www.project-redcap.org) is a HIPAA compliant tool for managing online surveys and databases, commonly used by health researchers.

#### Examples of FHIR for data transformation

FHIR does not have to be used as a replacement for data models, it can be complementary. Lenert et al., 2021 [@Lenert_Ilatovskiy_Agnew_Rudisill_Jacobs_Weatherston_Deans_Jr_2021] tests a method of using FHIR as a canonical data standard for consolidating COVID-19 data from multiple institutionals, and then distributing the data to PCORnet and OMOP for analysis. The authors describe this method as a, "best of both worlds" approach since FHIR is designed for accurate representation of clinical events, while PCORnet and OMOP are useful for computation and analysis of the clinical events. 

Using FHIR as the canonical data standard and then transmitting the data to other CDMs shortened the timeline from data aquisition to analytics which was critical for an emerging pandemic like COVID-19 and could be helpful for other rapidly changing clinical research.

Wood et al. 2021 offers another example of using both OMOP and FHIR [@Wood_Marks_Plovnick_Hewitt_Neuberg_Walters_Dolan_Tucker_Abrams_Thompson_etal._2021]. The authors created disease-specific learning communities from real-world data. Using OMOP and FHIR reduces burden and ensures sustainability for the learning community by routinely ingesting patients' entire EHR. Working with both data standards also opens participation to more data sources like health care systems, hospitals, and outpatient practices, that already use OMOP or FHIR. 

In some instances, transforming health data between data models and using FHIR allows researchers to bend the data to fit their needs. Rinalid & Thun 2021 [@Rinaldi_Thun_2021] mapped openEHR information to FHIR, and then to an OMOP CDM. The process brought together data from 8 university hospitals in Germany to create an infection surveillance consortium with more recent, rapidly updated information. The group planned to use openEHR to model infection-related information, but also wanted to conform to the Medical Informatics Initiatve (MII), which requires member organizations to use FHIR. However, FHIR is designed to support patient-level data but the consortium wanted a population-level perspective with the ability to store and analyze data. They found that OMOP provided a better holistic-view and the analytical capabilities they needed. Transforming through the three models allowed them to take advantage of the benefits each offered while maintaining interoperability between the hospitals and the MII.

 <!--# FIX: Link to REDCap module(s)/content --KMB -->

 <!--# DISCUSS: Does REDCap fit in this section or should it be moved to it's own spot? --KMB -->

REDCap is another useful, FHIR-compatible tool. Cheng et al. 2021 [@Cheng_Duda_Taylor_Delacqua_Lewis_Bosler_Johnson_Harris_2021] describes the development of the Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS), which facilitates the exhcange of data between REDCap and any EHR via the FHIR API. The authors tested two use cases for CDIS: Clinical Data Pull (CDP) and Clinical Data Mart (CDM).

The CDP use case would apply to prospective studies that aggregate data and fill out case report forms (CRFs) for study participants. The CDM use case is for studies with a known cohort of patients and requires a bulk data extraction from an EHR. At the time of publishing, 55 CDP projects and 27 CDM projects had been implemented. Both use cases significantly reduced manual data entry into REDCap. CDIS has also proven to be repurposable between projects at an institution, without the need for support from IT staff.

![The CDIS workflow uses FHIR to simplify the process of creating a registry from EHR data.](images/cheng-fhir-shortcut.png)

### SMART on FHIR

[SMART on FHIR](https://smarthealthit.org/about-smart-2/) is an application programming interface (API) that enables interoperability between applications and any healthcare system with a FHIR-enabled EHR. A widely used implementation of SMART on FHIR is the Apple Health Records API, which allows iPhone users to request records from EHRs and other health systems, and then store the information on their mobile device.

SMART has an [app gallery](https://apps.smarthealthit.org/apps?sort=name-asc) for viewing developers' applications that can be implemented in an EHR.

#### Example of SMART on FHIR

Wagholikar et al. 2017 [@Wagholikar_Jain_Oliveira_Mandel_Klann_Colas_Patil_Yadav_Mandl_Carton_etal._2017] trialed sharing SMART on FHIR apps at Partners Healthcare (PHC) in Boston, Massachusetts and REACHnet Data Center (RDC) in New Orleans, Louisiana. <!--# DISCUSS: I included the institutions because one of them (RDC) includes some of the same colleges and medical centers as the LA CaTS CTR. That won't be useful to other CTRs and the broader public when the course is shared though and I don't call out other institutions from the other papers so it feels kind of forced. I'm unsure whether I should include or not.--KMB -->, were <!--# FIX: I think were is correct in this instance...--KMB -->

EHR data for select patients from the two institutions were <!--# FIX: I think were is correct in this instance...--KMB -->imported to Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute’s (PCORI) CDM and stored in Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2)repositories. 

![The proposed model for using SMART on FHIR to collaborate across institutions and their respective EHRs.](images/wagholikar-proposed-approach.png) 

SMART-on-FHIR was then used for the transformation from PCORI's CDM to FHIR. Once the data was in FHIR-format, the authors tested four SMART apps from the app gallery. 

![The data pipeline used to move data from EHRs to SMART apps.](images/wagholikar-pipline.png)

At PHC, the pipeline ran smoothly and the validation process indicated that all data was accounted for in the SMART apps. The implementation at RCD also ran smoothly, with the exception of a cardiac-risk app that signaled missing data. Further investigation revealed that the SMART on FHIR platform could not support the complex query used in certain FHIR resources.

Despite the limitation to certain FHIR resources, the SMART on FHIR framework and apps can be used to share research infrastructure and collaborate across institutions. The SMART app can integrate with different EHRs, removing some interoperability barriers.   

<!--# FIX: Link to SMART on FHIR topic. --MM -->

### Patient-facing apps

FHIR can also be used to create interoperable, patient-facing apps that collect data or enable researcher-participant messaging. Some apps listed in the SMART app gallery linked above are patient-facing apps.

#### Examples of FHIR for patient-facing apps

Pfiffner et al. 2016 [@Pfiffner_Pinyol_Natter_Mandl_2016] created an extension, dubbed C3-PRO, that connects Apple's ResearchKit to health systems. C3-PRO is a clever name for the full platform: the Consent, Contact, and Community framework for Patient Reported Outcomes. The open source tool uses FHIR to connect any Apple ResearchKit app to the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) standard. They found that FHIR formats standardizes the the survey questions and consent libraries for study participation. And since they are standardized, they can be reused across other studies.

The initial test case for C3-PRO, trialed in Pfiffner et al. 2016 [@Pfiffner_Pinyol_Natter_Mandl_2016], was to enroll a completely anonymous cohort in a study using data from i2b2. Participants used an app to track and report their symptoms of Hepatitis C for improved treatment. For any type of study though, C3-PRO could use FHIR to determine participant eligibility, format informed consent documents, and generate the actual surveys.

Ahmad et al., 2020 [@Ahmad_Payne_Lackey_Komeshak_Kenney_Magnusen_Metts_Bailey_2020] uses REDCap to program surveys, and Apple ResearchKit to render and deliver them in a user-friendly format. The responses are then sent back to REDCap and a proprietary program that converts the data into an HL7 message, which is then added to the patient's EHR. A clinical decision support (CDS) tool then provided a suggested battery of tests based on the responses. The survey used in their study was offered to 15-21 year old patients that arrived in the ER. The objective of the survey was to determine what, if any, tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) would be most appropriate for the patients. Despite the potentially sensitive subject matter, 88.9% of patients that completed the survey rated it to be "somewhat" or "very comfortable" to answer the questions electronically and 72.2% preferred the digital method over a face-to-face conversation or paper questionnaire.

While Ahmad et al., 2020 used HL7 messages, a predecessor and alternative to FHIR, it is possible that the same methodology could be adapted to use FHIR instead. Apple Health uses FHIR, so an institution with an EHR that is FHIR-connected should already have endpoints for importing data from survey tools like Apple ResearchKit. This methodology could be reapplied to other sensitive health questions, or even for routine collection of health information.

### Multi-site research

Multi-site data-sharing requires standardized formats and common terminologies, which can be facilitated by FHIR. A larger pool of data from multiple healthcare institutions can support more comprehensive studies with broader groups of patients to draw from for research participation.

#### Example fo FHIR for multi-site research

<!--# DISCUSS: I'm second-guessing whether Gruender et al. 2022 is a good example to highlight because it's a steeper implementation curve than some of the other examples listed here. Not sure how motivational it is when the bar is this high...--KMB -->

Often, one of the initial steps in a study design is to determine the patient population that could particiapte in the study or be impacted by the work. However, if researchers can only query patient records local to their institution, they have an incomplete picture of the total patient population. Gruendner et al. 2022 [@Gruendner_Deppenwiese_Folz_Köhler_Kroll_Prokosch_Rosenau_Rühle_Scheidl_Schüttler_etal._2022] eliminated this institutional barrier by designing a feasiblity query that works across multiple health centers in Germany. The query process involved four components:

  1. user-interface for writing queries
  2. backend for translating the user input to a standardized format
  3. middleware to transport the query
  4. execution service to convert the standardized query to FHIR

For the query to work though, all participating insitutions had to share a common ontology and terminology mappings. The authors tested their feasibility query with 33 university hospitals in Germany, using synthetic data containing millions of FHIR resources. The feasibility query returned the number of patients that match the requested criteria within seconds. The authors note that they could easily tweak the returned value to be patient IDs to create a cohort.
