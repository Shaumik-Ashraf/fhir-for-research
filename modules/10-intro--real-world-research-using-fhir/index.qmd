## Learning Objectives

1.  Develop high-level understanding of how FHIR has been utilized in research.
2.  Identify examples of FHIR used in research that are applicable to current or future work.

## FHIR for Research

FHIR has been adopted in many clinical settings, but its utilization in research has been slower. There are several ways FHIR could be beneficial to research though, including data-sharing, researcher and participant communication, and institutional collaboration.
 
## Research Themes

A review of studies that use FHIR in their research, including a meta-analysis of papers on FHIR for research [@duda2022], found four common themes of research that utilizes FHIR:

**Data Models**

As a standard for exchanging data, FHIR has been used in several studies to transform health data from different data models into an interoperable format. This is a common issue for studies or research that uses data from different sites, agencies, and sources.

Examples:

-   "Automated production of research data marts from a canonical fast healthcare interoperability resource data repository: applications to COVID-19 research" [@Lenert_Ilatovskiy_Agnew_Rudisill_Jacobs_Weatherston_Deans_Jr_2021] uses FHIR for rapid exchange of COVID-19 data and then transforms it to PCORnet and OMOP.

-   "ASH Research Collaborative: a real-world data infrastructure to support real-world evidence development and learning healthcare systems in hematology,"[@Wood_Marks_Plovnick_Hewitt_Neuberg_Walters_Dolan_Tucker_Abrams_Thompson_etal._2021] uses real-world data, OMOP, and FHIR to generate disease-specific learning communities. 

**SMART on FHIR**

[SMART on FHIR](https://smarthealthit.org/about-smart-2/) is an application programming interface (API) that enables interoperability between applications and any healthcare system using FHIR. A widely used implementation of SMART on FHIR is the Apple Health Records API, which allows iPhone users to store their health records on their device.

Example: "Evolving Research Data Sharing Networks to Clinical App Sharing Networks" [@Wagholikar_Jain_Oliveira_Mandel_Klann_Colas_Patil_Yadav_Mandl_Carton_etal._2017], trialed multi-site app sharing for shared decision-making between two different institutions using four SMART-on-FHIR apps. 

**Patient-Facing Apps**

FHIR can also be used to create interoperably patient-facing apps that can support research, either through data collection or facilitating research participant communication.

Example: "C3-PRO: Connecting ResearchKit to the Health System Using i2b2 and FHIR" [@Pfiffner_Pinyol_Natter_Mandl_2016], uses FHIR to facilitate the process and record-keeping of patient consent, health data, and patient-reported outcomes during the research process. 

**Multi-site Research**

FHIR is also an valuable tool for facilitating research across multiple sites. Data sharing is often necessary for multi-site initiatives. FHIR supports data-sharing with standardized formats and common terminologies.

Examples:

-   "The Architecture of a Feasibility Query Portal for Distributed COVID-19 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Patient Data Repositories: Design and Implementation Study" [@Gruendner_Deppenwiese_Folz_Köhler_Kroll_Prokosch_Rosenau_Rühle_Scheidl_Schüttler_etal._2022], describes the process of querying data, compiling in FHIR-format, and distributing to multiple hospitals for improved data accessibility. 

-   "From OpenEHR to FHIR and OMOP data model for microbiology findings" [@Rinaldi_Thun_2021], illustrates the process of collecting data from eight institutions, converting it from openEHR to FHIR-format, and then from the FHIR-format to OMOP to support different use cases while maintaining interoperability.
