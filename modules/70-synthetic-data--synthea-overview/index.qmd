It is often difficult to acquire or access real healthcare data for research purposes. Even in situations where data of interest actually exists in interoperable forms, privacy regulations such as HIPAA strictly limit what can be done with it. For many organizations such as hospitals that host their own data, research queries may require approval from an institutional review board (IRB) before they are allowed to be run against real data.  

**Synthetic data** is an alternative to real data, that is artifically generated (usually by a computer, but can be created in small amounts by hand) rather than collected from the real world. When real healthcare data is unavailable or insufficient due to privacy, cost, or other restrictions, synthetic data is often the best alternative for software development, training, or testing purposes.

::: callout-tip
## Synthetic data is not just deidentified data!

Deidentified, anonymized, or pseudonymized data are categories of real data where identifiers have been removed or altered for privacy reasons. Because this is real data it is extremely valuable for research purposes, however it also still carries the risk of re-identification.
On the other hand, because synthetic data is constructed, there is no privacy risk. When no individual's data was used to create the data, it is impossible for any individual's data to be in it.

## Synthea
**Syntheaâ„¢** is a synthetic data generator that models the life and medical history of synthetic patients to produce realistic, but not real, synthetic electronic health records. Synthea is open source and built entirely from publicly available information, so the resulting records are free of cost and free of privacy restrictions. The resulting records are intended to be realistic both at the individual level and at the population level.


[![](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/raw/gh-pages/images/architecture.png){fig-alt="Basic Data Architecture of Synthea, showing how various sources of data are used to create a synthetic population"}](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Architecture)


Synthea starts with demographic information for a given region, based on the US Census. These demographics are used to randomly seed the individuals in the population with a realistic race, sex, target age, etc. Each individual is simulated independently from birth until either death or to the current day. As each individual lives out their synthetic life they flow through modules representing the progression and treatment of various diseases - these "disease modules" are built up from publicly available statistics such as disease incidence and prevalence, along with care guidelines from medical institutions. No real person's data is ever used to create a Synthea module. Finally, once the simulation is complete, the patient record is exported into industry-standard formats such as FHIR (DSTU2, STU3, and/or R4), C-CDA, CSV, or plain text.

This page gives an overview of the basics and some of the key features of Synthea, but the [Synthea wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki) is a great resource for understanding the details of the various aspects of Synthea.


## Generic Modules
At the core of Synthea is a set of disease modules, representing the progression and treatment of various conditions. A small snippet of the Appendicitis is shown below.

![](../images/synthea_example_module.png){fig-alt="A section of the Synthea Appendicitis module, demonstrating some of the various types of states and transitions available in Synthea modules"}

These modules are state transition machines, where each individual flows through the modules based on logical conditions and weighted randomness. Every synthetic patient starts in each module at birth at an Initial state, and they immediately start progressing through. Each state represents a spot where something happens: some examples are a Delay state which waits a certain amount of time before progressing, commonly used to represent how the risk of certain conditions changes with age; or a ConditionOnset state to represent the spot where the patient acquires a given condition, not necessarily where it was diagnosed; or a Procedure state representing the point in time in a healthcare encounter that a procedure was performed. Each state has a transition that points to which state to go to next: direct transitions point to a single state, distributed transitions include multiple options with a weighting and one is chosen randomly each time, conditional transitions include logical criteria to choose which path to follow, and complex transitions are a combination of conditional and distributed. Modules will run until either the simulation ends (at patient death or when it reaches the current date) or until it reaches a Terminal state. (Terminal here means "the end of this module", not "the patient has a terminal condition and died". For instance the Appendicitis module terminates after the patient has an appendectomy. Compare to the Sore Throat module which does not have a Terminal state since people are always at risk of common viral conditions that present as sore throat.)


These simple concepts combined together allow for building up robust and detailed models of disease progression and treatment.

## A note on Synthea clinical detail

Because Synthea is open source and accepts contributions from a global user base, the level of detail does vary across modules. For instance, the Appendicitis module was the first to be created and the level of detail is fairly basic and minimal. On the other hand, the COVID-19 module and submodules were intentionally designed to replicate disease progression as closely as possible to early publications focused on early outbreaks in Wuhan, China and New York City, and is probably the largest and most detailed module. 

Further, the number of disease modules is limited. Early efforts focused on the "top ten" causes of premature death and reasons people see their primary care provider, and further additions have added a large number of modules representing common conditions, but rarer and more complex conditions may not be represented at all. The Synthea community encourages and welcomes users to create new modules representing conditions of interest, or to improve the detail and realism of existing modules.
:::


The [Synthea Module Builder](https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/) is a web interface for clinicians and other healthcare professionals to view, modify, and create Synthea modules with no programming experience required. A [short video introduction to the Module Builder is available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOfI6FOKv0s), and a [tutorial is available on the Wiki](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Module-Builder-Tutorial).


## FHIR Resources
The FHIR resources generated by Synthea tend to be fairly basic -- required fields are always present, but optional fields are rarely populated. If your use case requires fields not populated by Synthea, there are often ways to customize it for your needs. Additional info on customizing Synthea is available in the next section.

By default, Synthea will export one file per patient, as a transaction-type Bundle. Organizations and Practitioners are exported separately since these resources may be referenced by multiple patients' resources.
Synthea may also be configured to export Bulk FHIR.

As of April 2023, Synthea can produce the following resource types: 

-  `AllergyIntolerance`
-  `Bundle`
-  `CarePlan`
-  `Claim`
-  `Condition`
-  `Coverage` (R4 and STU3 only)
-  `DiagnosticReport` (for labs)
-  `Encounter`
-  `ExplanationOfBenefit` (R4 and STU3 only, Blue Button 2.0 Implementation Guide in STU3)
-  `Goal`
-  `ImagingStudy`
-  `Immunization` 
-  `MedicationRequest`
-  `MedicationAdministration`
-  `Observation`
-  `Organization`
-  `Patient`
-  `Practitioner`
-  `Procedure`

Resources only supported with R4 and US Core enabled:  

-  `CareTeam`
-  `Device`
-  `DiagnosticReport` (for clinical notes)
-  `DocumentReference` (for clinical notes)
-  `Location`
-  `Medication`
-  `PractitionerRole`
-  `Provenance`

## Pregenerated Datasets
As an alternative to running Synthea yourself, a number of datasets have already been generated and are available for download at the following locations:

 -  <https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads>
    -  Centralized location for datasets created by the Synthea core development team
 -  <https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/mCODE+Test+Data>
    -  Sample cancer patients with data conformant to the [mCODE FHIR IG](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/)
 -  <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QDXLWR>
    - 10,000 synthetic Medicare patients spanning the entire United States

## Prerequisites

<!-- this section through the end feel like they should be in a separate module. Maybe "getting started with synthea" or similar. they don't feel like they belong in the intro module. --LDC -->
Synthea requires the Javaâ„¢ JDK 11 or newer to be installed (make sure to select the JDK, not the JRE install). We recommend the prebuilt OpenJDK binaries available from
<https://adoptium.net/>.

## Basic Setup
For users who just want to run Synthea, and not make detailed changes to the internal models, the basic setup is recommended. However, the number of customizations available in this setup is limited. See the Developer Setup instructions in the next module for instructions if you want to make changes to Synthea.

1. Download the binary distribution to a file from 
<https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/releases/download/master-branch-latest/synthea-with-dependencies.jar>
)

2. Open a command-line prompt/terminal window and run Synthea by running the command `java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar` . Additional command-line options may be appended at the end of the command, see [Common Configuration](#common-configuration) below for details.

When you run this command, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Scanned 60 modules and 36 submodules.
Loading submodule modules/breast_cancer/tnm_diagnosis.json
Loading submodule modules/allergies/allergy_incidence.json
Loading submodule modules/dermatitis/moderate_cd_obs.json
...
Loading module modules/opioid_addiction.json
Loading module modules/dialysis.json
...
Loading module modules/hypertension.json
Running with options:
Population: 1
Seed: 1570658792125
Provider Seed:1570658792125
Location: Massachusetts
Min Age: 0
Max Age: 140
1 -- Arthur650 Carroll471 (39 y/o M) Southwick, Massachusetts 
{alive=1, dead=0}
```

Once the process completes, you will see an `output` folder alongside the `synthea-with-dependencies.jar`, and a `fhir` folder inside the `output` folder. Inside that `fhir` folder are the FHIR Bundle JSON files that were produced by Synthea. Each Bundle will contain a single Patient resource as the first entry, followed by resources roughly ordered by time.

## Common Configuration
Synthea includes a variety of command-line arguments and configuration options to enable or disable common settings, or change certain aspects of the output data. A small subset of the common options are listed below; more complete documentation is available on the Synthea wiki.

#### Command line arguments
```
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar [options] [state [city]]
[-p populationSize] (number of living patients to produce)
[-a minAge-MaxAge] (age range of patients to export)
[-g gender]
[-s seed] (for randomness / reproducibility -- runs with the same seed should produce the same results)
[-h] (print usage)
[--config=option ...] (any configuration option, see below)

Examples:
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar Massachusetts
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar Alaska Juneau
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -s 12345
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -p 1000
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -s 987 Washington Seattle
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -s 21 -p 100 Utah "Salt Lake City"
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -g M -a 60-65
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -p 10 --exporter.fhir.export=true
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar --exporter.baseDirectory="./output_tx/" Texas
```

#### Configuration Options
Many features can be configured using a properties file. The properties file syntax is one setting per line, with format `key = value`. Some of the most commonly modified settings are shown below.

<!--# This is not actually ruby, but there's no syntax highlighter for properties files and this seems to be the closest -->
```ruby
# Set the folder where exported records will be created.
# Each export type (e.g., FHIR, CCDA, CSV) will be a subfolder under this:
exporter.baseDirectory = ./output/

# Set to true to enable the FHIR R4 exporter:
exporter.fhir.export = true

# Set the number of years of active history to keep from each patient. Default: 10
# Set to 0 to keep all history from every patient, note this will increase file size significantly.
exporter.years_of_history = 10

# Set this to only include selected resource types: (e.g. Patient,Condition,Encounter)
exporter.fhir.included_resources =
# Set this to exclude certain resource types from export: (e.g. Observation)
exporter.fhir.excluded_resources =

# Set to false to enable adding numbers to synthetic patient names, to make it more obvious they are not real data.
generate.append_numbers_to_person_names = true
```


Synthea includes a default configuration file (which developers can find at `./src/main/resources/synthea.properties`). Each default setting can be individually overridden using a local settings file that is passed to Synthea when it is run with the `-c` flag:
```sh
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -c path/to/settings/file
```
Alternatively, individual configuration settings may be modified by a command-line flag. Any command-line argument starting with `--` will set the value of a configuration setting, for example:

```sh
java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar --generate.append_numbers_to_person_names=false
```
(note that when using this approach there should be no spaces between the setting name, equals sign, and setting value)

Additional information on configuration options can be found [on the Synthea wiki](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Common-Configuration).

You should now feel comfortable with the basics - what Synthea is and how to run it to generate synthetic health records. The next section will describe some options for customizing the patients that Synthea produces.
