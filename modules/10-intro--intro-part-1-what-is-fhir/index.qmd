4.  Understand the major problems that FHIR® helps solve in healthcare and research settings

## 1. Introduction

The story of FHIR is part of a greater narrative of healthcare and technology adoption. with the former being notoriously slow at adopting the latter. Computer systems and web technologies began to enter mainstream industries in the 1900s/2000s, while hospitals did not start largely adopting electronic health record (EHR) systems until the mid 2010s. 96% of hospitals in the United States currently have electronic health records (EHRs); however, that number was only 16% not too long ago in 2010. To put that into perspective, around the same time that technologies such as Windows 7 and the iPhone 4 were released, 84% of hospitals in the US were still using *paper* to communicate and store health information. The visual below shows the late but exponential rise of EHR adoption in the US in the past decade. [@ehr_adoption]

In this time before FHIR, data was siloed in health systems. Different systems within a hospital were "speaking different languages" with their data, resulting in nothing being shared and preventable medical mistakes due to clinicians lacking critical information. The peak in EHR adoption around 2014 in the plot also happens to coincide with the birth of FHIR. In response to growing FHIR adoption, data was finally able to be seamlessly shared between not only systems within a single health organization, but also between different health organizations.

So what is FHIR? How did it help solve this issue of siloed health information? In short, FHIR is a data exchange standard to help health organizations share data. It helps facilitate interoperability across a broad set of use cases and stakeholders.

Before diving deeper into FHIR, an important question still stands- what exactly is interoperability anyways? Why is it important in healthcare? This module will answer these questions first to set the stage for understanding what FHIR is and why it is so powerful.

## 2. What is Interoperability? Why is it Important?

**Interoperability** is the ability of computer systems to exchange data with unambiguous, shared meaning. It is easier to understand one another if we speak the same language and don't have to rely on translators.

The ability to deliver effective healthcare to all depends on the ability to share information and collaborate in providing care. Interoperability comes from **agreements** about how our systems will communicate, format, interpret meaning, and process shared information.

### 2.1 Impact of Lack of Interoperability on Stakeholders

**Poor communication across care providers.** Medication discrepancies such as drug omissions during transitions of care and multiple modes of information transmission result in delays in PAC services and can lead to adverse events and preventable readmissions. Redundant information collection creates inefficiencies and burden.

**Reliance on patient recall during periods of high stress.** Recall of information can be unreliable, as patients may be unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unresponsive/unable to communicate information. This in term increases patient/family stress.

**Increased cost and provider burden.** Additional costs exist related to hospital stays from adverse events and readmissions. Additional administrative costs also exist to locate, reconcile, and coordinate information.

### 2.2 Standards

**Standards** are agreed-upon methods for connecting systems together. They may pertain to security, data transport, data format or structure, or the meanings of codes or terms. They are defined, updated, and maintained by standards development organizations (SDOs) through a collaborative process involving the audience that will be using the standards. Some examples of standards in sectors other than healthcare:

-   ISO 6 - camera film speed

-   W3C - open web platform standards (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc.)

-   IEC 60309 - sockets, plugs, and connectors

Standards also come with **challenges**, as stakeholders have both common and differing needs. Creating one standard to fit all domains would results in large, slow systems. The only way for a standard to become effective is for everyone to adopt the same one.

[Health Level Seven (HL7®)](https://www.hl7.org/) is an ANSI-accredited SDO dedicated to providing a comprehensive framework and related standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information that supports clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of health services. Below are examples of HL7**®** standards for healthcare:

-   [Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA)](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/standards-technology/consolidated-cda-overview): framework for creating clinical documents that contain both human-readable text and machine-readable XML

-   [HL7® v2 Messaging](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185): commonly used data interchange standard that includes messaging specifications for patient administration, orders, results, scheduling, claims management, document management, and many others

-   [Quality Reporting Document Architecture](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Quality_Reporting_Document_Architecture): standard for communicating healthcare quality measures

-   [HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)](http://hl7.org/fhir/): specification for exchanging clinical and administrative healthcare data; based on REST, OAuth, and OpenID Connect

    -   [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/): simple authorization framework that enables a third-party application to obtain access to an HTTP service

    -   [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/): simple identity layer designed to work with OAuth 2.0

As seen above, **HL7® FHIR®** is not the first health IT standard. However, other standards have focused on specific user needs (e.g., quality measures) and have failed to achieve widespread adoption across industry. FHIR® is a new specification based on emerging industry approaches, informed by years of [lessons learned](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/comparison.html) around requirements, successes, and challenges from defining and implementing previous standards. FHIR**®** aims to simplify implementation without sacrificing information integrity. It leverages existing models and ensures alignment to previously defined best practices to provide a consistent, easy to implement, and rigorous mechanism for exchanging data between healthcare applications. There is widespread adoption of base FHIR**®** Resources, with profiles tailoring them to specific use cases.

### 2.3 Regulating Interoperability

The current health IT ecosystem is characterized by proprietary systems and closed data standards. In many cases, the only way to transfer data between sources is if both parties are in the same network and use the same IT systems (e.g., same EHR vendor). Patients do not have access to their own data and providers do not have access to complete patient records. Current economic incentives are not closing this gap.

In order to address these issues and improve health outcomes, the US government (including ONC, CMS, and others) is beginning to regulate the adoption of FHIR® as a single, common, open standard.

## 3. What is FHIR®?

![](images/fhir_acronym.png)

Healthcare records are increasingly becoming digitized. As patients move around the healthcare ecosystem, their electronic health records must be available, discoverable, and understandable. FHIR® is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. Standards establish a common language and process for all health IT systems to communicate, allowing information to be shared seamlessly and efficiently. FHIR® can be used as a stand-alone data exchange standard or with existing standards.

FHIR® is fast, efficient, and flexible. Its philosophy is to build a base set of resources that either by themselves or when combined satisfy the majority of use cases. It uses the **80/20 rule**, where 20% of the requirements satisfy 80% of the needs. Solutions are built from modular components called "Resources," which are described in detail in [3.3 Looking Closer: FHIR® Resources](#looking-closer-fhir-resources). There is also the option to develop custom extensions for a variety of use cases.

### 3.1 FHIR® Key Principles

-   Focus on **implementers**

-   Target support for **common scenarios**

-   Leverage cross-industry **web technologies**

-   Require **human readability** as base level of interoperability

-   Standard is **freely available**

-   Support multiple **paradigms and architectures**

-   Demonstrate best practice **governance**

### 3.2 Business Case: Why Promote FHIR®?

**Single standard for health care transactions.** FHIR® provides a standard for *both* administrative (claims, explanations of benefits, etc.) *and* clinical data.

**Reduced burden and operating costs.** Aligning industry on a single, common standard means that parties do not need to maintain complicated translation layers, manual processes, or numerous differing workflows for accomplishing a single task.

**Enables competition.** An open standards breaks down barriers to entry, allowing more open, free competition and lower costs.

**Empowers patients.** One standard allows developers to compile all different types of data, without the need for additional layers of translation, enabling patients and caregivers to access their information in one place.

**Greater data insights for healthier people**. Marrying these data sets will empower research, data science, and informatics, ultimately leading to healthier populations.

**Enables more equitable decision-making**. Access to different slices of medical data could be standardized through FHIR® to supplement socio-economic determinants of health.

### 3.3 Why Should You Understand FHIR®?

The level of FHIR® activity and adoption is increasing rapidly. FHIR® APIs are specifically required in the **ONC 21st Century Cures Act** [@cures_act] and the **CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Rule** [@cms_rule]. Federal agencies such as CMS, ONC, and CDC are increasingly looking for FHIR®-based solutions to healthcare problems. As a result, healthcare providers with access to health IT APIs using FHIR® is widespread.
