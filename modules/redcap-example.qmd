## Introduction

#### What is REDCap

Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a survey tool that can include questions on PHI. It was designed at Vanderbilt University with the intent of supporting data capture in low resource settings. 

#### What can REDCap be used for?

Although REDCap was originally designed for data capture from survey forms, researchers have adapted it to support:
-    registries
-    EHR data entry and extraction

<!--# The following two paragraphs that I commented out are also in the REDCap intro module. Was that intentional? -- kmb -->

<!--#[REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org) (which stands for "Research Electronic Data Capture") is another useful, FHIR-compatible tool. @Cheng_2021 describe the development of the Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS), which facilitates the exchange of data between REDCap and any EHR via the FHIR API. The authors tested two use cases for CDIS: Clinical Data Pull (CDP) and Clinical Data Mart (CDM).

The CDP use case would apply to prospective studies that aggregate data and fill out case report forms (CRFs) for study participants. The CDM use case is for studies with a known cohort of patients and requires a bulk data extraction from an EHR. At the time of publishing, 55 CDP projects and 27 CDM projects had been implemented. Both use cases significantly reduced manual data entry into REDCap. CDIS has also proven to be reusable between projects at an institution, without the need for support from IT staff.

## REDCap Adoption 



## REDCap as a Digital Alternative to Paper Forms

Hawley et al. (2021) [@Hawley_Yu_Bogetic_Potapova_Wakefield_Thompson_Kloiber_Hill_Jankowicz_Rotenberg_2021] describes a usability and implementation study at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in which they used REDCap to capture self-assessments from patients and transfer the data into a Cerner EHR. When a patient arrived The process saved time, improved the accuracy of data going into the EHR, and made the data accessbile in real-time. They also identified useful roles and responsibilities for implementing REDCap:

> -   **Clinical REDCap administrator**: Clinical REDCap staff responsible for account creation, modification, and suspension for all user types. Responsible for moving projects and draft changes to production. Limited to 2-3 staff members.
> -   **Project developer administrator**: Clinical REDCap staff responsible for creating REDCap projects and associated forms or surveys. Leads project validation to be carried out in collaboration with clinical stakeholders.
> -   **Service administrator**: Specialized account for managing secure services post data collection (eg, application programming interface data export to electronic health record).
> -   **Clinical data lead**: Clinical staff responsible for monitoring the integrity of the data, providing clinic-specific training to clinic users, supporting minor technical issues in the clinic, facilitating project validation, submitting project change requests, approving subordinate account requests, and serving as the main point of contact for developers and administrators.
> -   **Clinical care provider**: Clinical staff responsible for the administration and review of clinical assessments; can enter data that have been collected on paper into REDCap.
> -   **Clinical assistant**: Clinical support staff responsible for administering patient survey queue in the clinic and providing simple technical assistance.

## REDCap as a Registry

Lenert et al. (2023) [@Lenert_Jacobs_Agnew_Ding_Kirchoff_Weatherston_Deans_2023] tested a population-level vaccination status tracker, called VACtrac, using a combination of two approaches:

1. A FHIR-compatible copy of the existing statewide Immunization Information System (IIS), with a REDCap data warehouse
2. A REDCap health management program with a list of patients for providers to maintain communication with and update vaccination status records, either through a Bulk FHIR update or one-time query.

VACtrac uses REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) FHIR plug-in for both Epic and Cerner EHR, to extract patient information. The REDCap database can be accessed and updated by multiple providers, so the burden of maintaining vaccination information can be spread among multiple providers.

The [REDCap vaccination status tracker](https://github.com/vactraccovid/vactrac) is publically available for adaption in other institutions.

## Transforming REDCap Data to FHIR Resources

Metke-Jimenez & Hansen (2019) [@Metke-Jimenez_Hansen_2019] implemented FHIRCap, a transformation engine, to translate data in a REDCap project to FHIR resources. The authors tested FHIRCap on an existing REDCap form and database for a cancer registry. They were able to transform the infromation from REDCap to FHIR resources and then map the codes to SNOMED CT. While the process was manual and time intensive to set up, the rules only have to be written once for a project, and can be used as long as the REDCap form doesn't change.

FHIR and REDCap can also be used together to automate the process of population case report forms (CRFs), which could increase accuracy and decrease the burden of manual data entry. Cheng et al. (2022) [@Cheng_Banasiewicz_Johnson_Sulieman_Kennedy_Delacqua_Lewis_Joly_Bistran-Hall_Collins_2022] tested this hypothesis with an existing project that required manual data collecting and entry from EHRs to CRFs. The process was not FHIR compatible at the time so it served as a baseline to compare their automated process of the same data against.
