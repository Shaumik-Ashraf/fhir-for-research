## Learning Objectives

-   Understand at a high-level why FHIR® was developed in response to previous standards

-   Understand how a major part of the history of FHIR® is related to the development of basic web technologies

-   Have a good idea of where FHIR® will be going in the next 5 years based on its previous history

## 1. Evolution of HL7® Standards

HL7® has been developing standards for the **transfer of healthcare data** since the late 1980s, with three major standards being implemented since then. Each successive standard has been built on the lessons learned from the previous one, resulting in the current version of FHIR® today.

### 1.1 HL7® Version 2: Messages

Released in 1989, HL7® V2 allowed for the **simple transfer of messages** for clinical and patient care information. It was mainly **developed by clinical interface specialists** and is essentially a database query language that both developers can come up to speed quickly on and healthcare providers can use to send or request messages containing health data. The drawback of being so simple is that it does not support more complex interactions. It is currently the most widely used messaging standard in healthcare today, as it is the most mature.

### 1.2 HL7® Version 3: Clinical Documents

Released in 2005, HL7® V3 was created to address the challenges brought by the simplicity of HL7® V2. As opposed to clinical interface specialists, it was instead largely **influenced by government and healthcare information users**. In addition to just the simple transfer of messages, it specifies the **content of the data** **exchanged** between healthcare applications as well as **how the exchange is implemented** and managed. This data model was used in the developed of **HL7® Clinical Documentation Architecture (CDA)**, which is a framework for creating clinical documents.

This era of HL7® standards attempted to increase adoption yet ran into hurdles of its own:

1.  HL7® V3 is not backwards compatible with HL7® V2, meaning existing interfaces cannot communicate with its implementations
2.  HL7® V3 and HL7® CDA are very complex and not clearly specified, requiring significant onboarding for developers to understand

In response to these issues, HL7® V3 adoption has not been as large as HL7® V2, as it is primarily used in systems that either have never had HL7® V2 implementations or in areas with government enforcement of HL7® V3 usage.

### 1.3 FHIR®: Web Technologies

In the early 2010s, the scope of data sharing in the healthcare space needed to be broadened, going beyond simple messages and clinical documents to span organizations, disciplines, and borders. The expansion of mobile and cloud-based applications was slowly finding its way into the healthcare space and standards needed to keep up. Thus enters HL7® FHIR®, which is an alternative to document-centric approaches and leverages **web technologies such as HTTP-based RESTful APIs** to expand both the type of information that can be exchanged as well as the types of systems that can exchange it.

With a major goal being to facilitate interoperability between legacy health care systems, it both builds upon previous standards (HL7® V2, HL7® V3, HL7® CDA) as well as adopts modern web technologies. FHIR® has been able to bridge the gap between 30 year old standards and modern web-based connectivity. And with its focus away from specified messages/documents and more towards the use of small building blocks (Resources) to build implementations, it can be customized to fit much more use cases compared to its predecessors.

## 2. FHIR® Eras

### 2.1 1993-2014: Early Concepts

The basic concepts of FHIR® start with the beginnings of the internet in the mid 1990s. Web 1.0 was largely based on static pages using **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** to retrieve them. With such as limited system, **REST (REpresentational State Transfer)** was developed and popularized in the early 2000s. Its purpose was to create a standard framework for HTTP that could allow two servers to communicate and exchange data anywhere in the world, thus providing the structure for Web 2.0 and the explosion of worldwide websites in the 2000s.

At this point in time, healthcare data exchange was very limited to sending messages and documents and was not using any web-based transactional frameworks. Then in the late 2000s, the idea emerged to apply RESTful data exchange principles in healthcare within HL7® and its interoperability/web development partners. FHIR® was then officially introduced in 2012, beginning the era of healthcare API development and web-based health data exchange. Shortly after, support also came from the JASON task force, which is an independent group of elite scientists that has advised the government on matters of science and technology since the 1960s. In 2013, the [JASON Report titled "A Robust Health Data Infrastructure"](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/ptp13-700hhs_white.pdf) was published and called for health data APIs to be developed to liberate data that was locked in electronic health records. This helped pave the way for significant government support of FHIR® in the coming years.

### 2.2. 2014-2018: Developing the Core

In late 2014, the first official version of FHIR® was released, kicking off its second era where core development would begin. By 2015, 87% of hospitals in the US were using FHIR® certified EHRs.

Around this time, both government and industry began to develop initiatives in response to the 2013 JASON Report. On the government side, the **Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC)** was in the beginnings of discussions around national standards for APIs. On the industry side, the **Argonaut Project** began, which is a private sector initiated and funded implementation community comprised of technology vendors and provider organizations. Its goal is to accelerate the use of FHIR in healthcare information exchange in a way that can be adopted by industry-specific needs and use cases. This specification was released in 2017 and formed the basis what is now known as US Core, discussed further in the FHIR From 10,000 Feet module.

The late 2010s saw adoption from more industry-based vendors, with a notable example being Apple using FHIR® in its HealthKit API to access consumer healthcare data. This brought significant legitmacy to the use of FHIR® for not only healthcare systems but also the commercial tech space, with giants such as Google and Microsoft quickly following suit.

### 2.3 2018-Present: Acceleration

By 2019, FHIR® had reached maturity to a point that brought in the third major era, which saw an increase in the use of the [HL7® FHIR® Accelerator](https://www.hl7.org/about/fhir-accelerator/) program. This program was designed by HL7 to "assist communities and collaborative groups across the global health care spectrum in the creation and adoption of high quality FHIR® Implementation Guides or other standard artifacts to move toward the realization of global health data interoperability." These projects are developing communities around specific use cases for FHIR®, further accelerating its implementation across the healthcare field. Below are examples of current use cases explored by these Accelerators:

-   Standardizing cancer data

-   Standardizing social determinants of health

-   Establishing a process for addressing value-based care delivery

-   Obtaining data for research via FHIR®

-   Obtaining data for public health via FHIR®

In the coming years, more FHIR® resources will become mature and **normative**, along with an expansion of FHIR® Accelerators and their use cases. However, the current state of FHIR® is still far from realizing the vision of interoperability. The most important future eras have not been entered yet, which involve full-scale development and having a nationwide impact. One of the biggest factors to reach these new eras is the question of **who will pay** for such a signficant change. Scaling FHIR® to nationwide development includes complex and expensive changes/additions to existing IT systems, with organizations such as the US public health system and community health centers already limited budgets. The government (mainly ONC and CMS) have sponsored the developmenet of FHIR® standards for the past decade, but the main cost for nationwide deployment still remains to be solved.

## 3. FHIR® Version History

ONC has provided a brief but comprehensive [summary](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2021-04/FHIR%20Version%20History%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf) of the version history of FHIR releases since its debut in 2012:

> HL7® FHIR® has evolved through four releases since its initial presentation in May 2012. It has grown from a true draft standard with 49 Resources to its current 145 and continues to expand. In that time the standard has improved and changed to meet the needs of the health information technology community.

### 3.1 Draft Standard for Trial Use 1 (DSTU1)

> FHIR's first publication in September 2013 showed a new way forward for health care data exchange. Draft Standard for Trial Use 1 had 49 resources and focused on two use cases, creating a Personal Health Record on a mobile device and the retrieval of documents, such as encounter or discharge notes, to a mobile device. This initial release sparked the community's interest in expanding FHIR to cover a wider variety of health care and health IT needs.

### 3.2 Draft Standard for Trial Use 2 (DSTU2)

> FHIR grew in market acceptance with the publication of the Draft Standard for Trial Use 2 in 2015. Efforts including the Argonaut Project developed Implementation Guides (IGs) and other technologies to support FHIR adoption by EHR developers and other health IT entities. The structure of Resources was adjusted to make creating extensions easier, allowing for more use cases to be covered without changes to the core standard. New Resources were also added to support non-clinical data, including claims and benefits processing.
>
> The publication of FHIR DSTU2 included the creation of the FHIR® Maturity Model (FMM). When new Resources are created, they are not immediately ready for use in live settings; they must be refined and tested for a variety of uses and settings. The FHIR Maturity Model established a set of levels that progressively measure technical advancement, known as maturity. Resource maturity as defined by the FMM begins with an initial draft and achieves final status with implementation in multiple settings. Since the maturity of the FHIR standard overall is not tied to the maturity of Resources, Resources can move up the maturity ladder between FHIR releases. The FMM, which is also applied to other components of the FHIR standard, defines Resource stability with six levels:
>
> -   **FMM0 (Draft)**: The Resource is still in early development but has been accepted into the FHIR standard
>
> -   **FMM1**: The Resource has no current technical errors and is believed to address all design goals
>
> -   **FMM2**: The Resources has been tested and approved at a FHIR® Connectathon with multiple FHIR®-enabled computer systems tested
>
> -   **FMM3**: The Resource passed all quality checks and an HL7® community ballot that determins if it is ready for trial use
>
> -   **FMM4**: The Resource has been tested for functionality for all intended purposes, has been published in a formal HL7® publication, and is operating in at least one prototype system
>
> -   **FMM5**: The Resource is in use in at least five distinct systems operating in at least two countries
>
> Substantive changes at the FMM4 or FMM5 levels that would change usage from those already established or would break compatibility with existing implementations would require significant justification to be accepted and to move forward. After FMM5, a Resource reaches "normative" level; at this level, future changes must be backwards compatible so that applications that implement those Resources aren't at risk of being broken as the FHIR standard changes.

### 3.3 Standard for Trial Use 3 (STU 3)

> FHIR Standard for Trial Use 3 was released in 2017 with improvements to the core Clinical, Administrative, and Financial Resources, improvements to the Clinical Decision Support and Clinical Quality Measure Resources and a new framework for workflow and task management. Additionally, tools were introduced that made FHIR IG creation and publication to the web easier, faster, and more unified.

### 3.4 Release 4 (R4)

> As the first release with normative content, the 2019 release of FHIR Release 4 left behind the Trial Use name. Two key clinical Resources, Patient and Observation, were released as normative, along with the RESTful API, the XML and JSON formats, and nine additional Resources.
>
> In 2020, ONC published the Final Rule for the 21st Century Cures Act, establishing FHIR R4 as the standard required for Health IT Certification.

### 3.5 Looking ahead to Release 5 (R5)

> FHIR Release 5 will see increased normative content, with over 30 Resources having been nominated by their HL7 Workgroups to be matured to that status. In addition, the community will continue to develop the supportive specifications to FHIR, such as the authorization framework SMART, Clinical Decision Support Hooks (CDS Hooks), and the Bulk Data Transfer specification, which will help implementers create a complete FHIR-based exchange of health care data.
>
> With the maturing of the FHIR IG tools and templates, better integration with public health, imaging, financial management, genomics and other fields will keep FHIR at the forefront of health IT.
