FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) define a "[set of rules of how a particular interoperability or standards problem is solved](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R5/implementationguide.html)."

IGs are published as web pages (like the [ones listed here](data-modeling-real-world-igs.qmd)) that include both human-readable and machine-readable versions of the rules. For example, the [human-readable version of US Core's Patient profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/structuredefinition-us-core-patient.html) and [the machine-readable version](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.profile.json.html) are published alongside each other in the US Core IG. Additionally, IGs typically include substantial narrative content describing the problem they are addressing and providing additional context for their rules.

Researchers who are working with FHIR will likely need to read FHIR IGs, including those that are not specifically designed for research purposes (like [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/)).

FHIR IGs typically share a common structure and format (especially those published through HL7). The [CodeX FHIR Accelerator](https://codex.hl7.org) has published a [set of comprehensive resources on IG authoring](https://fshschool.org/courses/) that includes a detailed explanation of how to read and understand these common elements across IGs.
