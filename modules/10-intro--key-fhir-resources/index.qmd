## Learning Objectives
 - Learn of key healthcare resources such as Patient, Observation, and Bundle
 - Understand how FHIR defines resources with great granularity and flexibility
 - Understand how FHIR encapsulates metadata as resources

## 1. Overview of Core Elements

Recall that FHIR itself stands for _Fast Healthcare Interoperability **Resources**_. The FHIR Core defines, among other things,
140 Resources that are the building blocks for healthcare interoperability. The [HL7 FHIR Website](https://hl7.org/fhir) gives
a well structured summary of the FHIR Core:

![Levels classification for FHIR Core](images/fhir-index-delinked.png)

As shown above the FHIR Core is tiered into 5 levels. The lower levels define primitive data types, complex data types, encodings, and other
infrastructure required to implement FHIR. Progressively higher levels begin to encapsulate clinical information, with level 3 defining intuitive
Resources such as `Patient` and level 5 representing clinical workflows or medical knowledge with the intended use of Clinical Decision Support.

The resource itself may be encoded in JSON, XML, or Turtle with processing done by any programming language or software tool. The FHIR standard
and Resource specifications are for defining the semantics necessary to transfer clinical information. FHIR is granular enough to capture the
most miniscule piece of information possible, but also flexible enough to work with a variety of medical informatics standards such as LOINC or ICD.
A Resource can also extend itself to encompase new discoveries, profile itself for more specific use cases, define metadata for powerful autoconfiguration,
and carry human-readible data for manual stewardship.

To best best understand how FHIR accomplishes this, lets examine the Patient resource.
