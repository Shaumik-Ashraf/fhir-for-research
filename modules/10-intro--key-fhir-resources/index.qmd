## Learning Objectives
 - Learn of key healthcare resources such as Patient, Observation, and Bundle
 - Understand how FHIR defines resources with great granularity and flexibility
 - Understand how FHIR encapsulates metadata as resources

## 1. Overview of Core Elements

The [HL7 FHIR Website](https://hl7.org/fhir) gives a well structured summary of most Resources in FHIR Core:

![Levels classification for FHIR Core](images/fhir-index-delinked.png)

As shown above the FHIR Core is tiered into 5 levels.

A lower level refers to fundamental definitions required for a software developer to implement FHIR, while higher
level resources correspond more directly to clinical use cases. FHIR itself stands for _Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources_, so each of these resources encapsulate a piece of clinical information in transit and the resource structure defines
the semantics for embedding clinical information. The resource itself may be encoded in JSON or XML and processed by any programming
language or software tool. What FHIR enables is a way to define and structure the _semantics_ of clinical information for meaningful
communication. FHIR is granular enough to capture the most miniscule information possible, while also flexible enough to work with a
variety of medical informatics standards such as LOINC or ICD and also expand to new discoveries or workflows in healthcare. To best
best understand how FHIR accomplishes this, lets examine the Patient resource.
