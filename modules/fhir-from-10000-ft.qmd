learning_objectives:
  - question: What role does FHIR play in health data interoperability?
    answer: FHIR is becoming the ubiquitous specification governing interoperability of health systems. This is driven both by regulation in the US, and by FHIR's pragmatic implementation-first approach.
  - question: Why is FHIR currently relevant for research?
    answer: At a high level, FHIR is now well-adopted throughout the US healthcare system thanks to ONC and CMS rules. FHIR's openness, active development with an implementer-first approach, and extensibility make it a flexible tool for research.
  - question: What are areas where FHIR can enhance research?
    answer: 1) Providing direct access to health data through a standardized API that would otherwise have to be accessed with one-off analyst work, or through a more complex workflow.<br><br>2) Defining a data model for research that can be implemented using existing FHIR resources and API endpoints.

## EHRs and interoperability

Electronic health record (EHR) systems have been [broadly adopted throughout the US since 2014](https://www.healthit.gov/data/quickstats/national-trends-hospital-and-physician-adoption-electronic-health-records) (see graph below).

![Source: ONC/American Hospital Association (AHA), [AHA Annual Survey Information Technology Supplement](https://www.healthit.gov/data/quickstats/national-trends-hospital-and-physician-adoption-electronic-health-records), 2019-2021.](images/ehr_adoption.png){#fig-ehr-adoption fig-alt="Graph showing trend in hospital and physician EHR adoption form 2008 to 2021. Adoption is between 10 and 20% in 2008, rising to >70% in 2014."}

**Interoperability**, or the ability to exchange data across EHRs and ancillary systems has lagged behind their adoption. Improving interoperability remains an important challenge for the the implementers and users of EHRs, including researchers who wish to utilize EHR data in their work.

FHIR is one of the key technologies that enables interoperability of health-related data.

[HIMSS](https://www.himss.org/resources/interoperability-healthcare)[^1] [defines interoperability](https://www.himss.org/resources/interoperability-healthcare) as:

[^1]: HIMSS is the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society. [Its mission](https://www.himss.org/who-we-are) is to "reform the global health ecosystem through the power of information and technology."

> The ability of different information systems, devices and applications (systems) to access, exchange, integrate and cooperatively use data in a coordinated manner, within and across organizational, regional and national boundaries, to provide timely and seamless portability of information and optimize the health of individuals and populations globally.

[ONC](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability)[^2] describes the importance of interoperability:

[^2]: ONC is [The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability).

    From [their website](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/about-onc):

    > ONC is the principal federal entity charged with coordination of nationwide efforts to implement and use the most advanced health information technology and the electronic exchange of health information.

> Interoperability helps clinicians deliver safe, effective, patient-centered care. It also provides new ways for individuals and caregivers to access electronic health information to manage and coordinate care. Advancing interoperability is now an essential part of most health care activities ranging from health equity to public health emergency response.

Below is additional background on interoperability and the technologies that enable it, including FHIR.

## FHIR is key to the US health data interoperability ecosystem

The [ONC 21st Century Cures Act](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/cures) (known as the "Cures Act") supports seamless and secure access to health information. As part of Cures Act, ONC established a set of interoperability criteria to the existing 2015 [Health IT Certification Program](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/certification-health-it). These criteria include:

-   "Standardized access to single patient and multiple patient services via an API(s) using the HL7 FHIR standard" [@ONC_2015_Edition]

-   Use of United States Core Data for Interoperability ([USCDI](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi)) standard as part of these APIs [@ONC_2020_USCDI], which is implemented in FHIR with the [US Core](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/) FHIR Implementation Guide

While the Health IT Certification Program is voluntary, [CMS provides a financial incentive](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Certification) to health systems that use certified EHRs. This means that FHIR and USCDI support is now built into many EHRs and other health data systems to meet [ONC's December 2022 deadline](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/Highlighted_Regulatory_Dates_All.pdf) regarding the new HL7 FHIR API capabilities.

### FHIR is becoming ubiquitous

As of 2019, [84% of hospitals had adopted FHIR](https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/health-it/the-heat-is-on-us-caught-fhir-in-2019) and it is widely used in the health technology ecosystem beyond EHRs. For example, [Apple's HealthKit uses FHIR](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/samples/accessing_health_records) for accessing data from healthcare institutions. The major public cloud providers ([Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/healthlake/), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/concepts/fhir), and [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/health-data-services)) also provide FHIR functionality. FHIR is an international standard and is actively used outside the US.[^3]

[^3]: For example, there are a number of internationally-focused FHIR Implementation Guides: <http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/>.

## FHIR's focus on implementation is beneficial to research uses

FHIR has a number of characteristics that benefit research:

-   The FHIR specification is open source, and is actively improved through open source development principles.

-   There are no inherent fees when using FHIR (though technology vendors may charge fees related to using their products that implement FHIR).

-   FHIR uses common web technologies, which are widely used in technology outside of health care and allow software developers without prior FHIR experience to quickly climb the learning curve.

-   The FHIR specification is easily customized and extended to meet the needs of a specific use case (e.g., [representing oncology data](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/)).

For more background, please see the [Fundamental Principles of FHIR](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Fundamental+Principles+of+FHIR) from HL7's documentation.

## FHIR provides a uniform data model and API for sharing data

The FHIR specification provides an extensible set of "resources" for defining different types of data, like [`Patient`](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html) for representing demographics and administrative information about an individual, and [`Observation`](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html) for representing measurements and assertions about a patient or other subject. These FHIR resources are [designed to include data elements that cover the majority of use cases](http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=1924), and the FHIR specification provides [mechanisms](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html) for extending data models when necessary.

FHIR also provides an API (Application Programming Interface; see [Wikipedia for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)) that provides a standardized way for systems to request and receive FHIR data.

The FHIR specification also discusses the [security concerns related to FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html) including recommended best practices.

### Research implications

These features of FHIR, along with its widespread adoption, provide researchers an opportunity to access data with a more standardized, reproducible approach. FHIR also facilitates direct data integration with other software (e.g., mobile apps) that would be much more difficult otherwise.
