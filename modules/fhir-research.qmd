  - question: How have researchers used FHIR in the past?
    answer: Researchers have used FHIR to extract data from EHRs, define phenotypes that are portable across systems and institutions, and enable research that requires integration with clinical workflows.
---

FHIR has been used in a number of areas of published research, usually related to extracting data from EHRs, defining phenotypes that are portable across systems and institutions, or enabling research that requires integration with clinical workflows (e.g., evaluating a new clinical decision support tool, or integrating a new data source into an EHR workflow).

Below are summaries of some recent examples of published research in each of these areas. At the bottom of this page are a list of other journal articles about research involving FHIR.

## Extracting data

-   @cheng2023 demonstrate that FHIR can be used to automatically populate clinical trial case report forms. In a COVID-19-related trial at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, they were able to populate 10,081 of 11,952 values (84%) using FHIR, with 89% concordance with human entry. Manual review indicated that discordance with human entry was often due to data entry error, suggesting that the FHIR-based approach could improve accuracy over manual chart abstraction.

-   @zong2021 evaluated using FHIR to automatically case report forms for a colorectal cancer clinical trial. The were able to successfully extract a portion of the data needed to fill case report forms with 98.5% positive predictive value and 96.2% sensitivity using clinical records from 331 Mayo Clinic patients.

-   @Lenert_2021 describes a method of using FHIR to replace custom data pipelines for extracting COVID-19 data from EHRs. They demonstrated using FHIR to populate [PCORnet](https://pcornet.org/) and [OMOP](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/) databases with significantly less delay than their previous approaches for generating these databases. (For more information on PCORnet and OMOP, please see [Common Data Models](cdms.qmd).) This approach should be portable across EHRs and institutions.

-   @Wood_2021 discuss building a "Data Hub" that includes clinical data from multiple institutions for hematology research. They support ingesting data from both FHIR endpoints and OMOP databases with the goal of reducing the informatics burden on participating institutions.

## Phenotype portability

-   @brandt2022 developed an approach for cross-institution phenotype definitions (also known as cohort definitions) using a combination of FHIR and Clinical Quality Language ([CQL](https://cql.hl7.org), another HL7 standard for expressing inclusion and exclusion logic). Their system was successfully used across three institutions to identify cases and non-cases by [generating queries](https://github.com/PheMA/cql-on-omop) to run against existing [OMOP](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/) databases. Other institutions that do not have OMOP research databases could theoretically use FHIR and CQL directly to identify cases and non-cases, though this was not tested by the authors.

-   @Gruendner_2022 also developed a cross-institution phenotyping approach using FHIR and CQL. To do this, they created a system with four components:

    1.  User-interface for writing queries
    2.  Backend for translating the user input to a standardized format
    3.  Middleware to transport the query
    4.  Execution service to convert the standardized query to FHIR

    They demonstrated their approach could be deployed at multiple institutions and scale to millions of records using synthetic data.

## Interacting with clinical workflows

FHIR can be used to integrate third-party applications with EHRs using [SMART on FHIR](https://smarthealthit.org/about-smart-2/), a standard that enables "write once, use everywhere" integration. Please see the [SMART on FHIR Introduction page](smart-on-fhir-intro.qmd#research-use-cases) for more information on real-world research use cases, including clinical decision support and data integration.

SMART on FHIR can also be used to provide patients access to their clinical data directly from their provider's EHR. As of April 2023, we were not able to find examples of this capability's use for research.
