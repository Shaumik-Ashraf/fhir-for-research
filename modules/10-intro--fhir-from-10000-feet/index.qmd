## Learning Objectives

1.  Understand what FHIR**®** is at a high-level
2.  Understand the major problems that FHIR**®** helps solve in healthcare
3.  Understand what FHIR**®** Resources are and how they can be applied to many use cases in healthcare

## 1. What is Interoperability? Why is it Important?

**Interoperability** is the ability of computer systems to exchange data with unambiguous, shared meaning. It is easier to understand one another if we speak the same language and don't have to rely on translators - imagine if every electronic device required a different power adaptor.

The ability to deliver effective healthcare to all depends on the ability to share information and collaborate in providing care. Interoperability comes from **agreements** about how our systems will communicate, format, interpret meaning, and process shared information.

### 1.1 Impact of Lack of Interoperability on Stakeholders

**Poor communication across care providers.** Medication discrepencies such as drug omissions during transitions of care and multiple modes of information transmission result in delays in PAC services and can lead to adverse events and preventable readmissions. Redundant information collection creates inefficiencies and burden.

**Reliance on patient recall during periods of high stress.** Recall of information can be unreliable, as patients may be unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unresponsive/unable to communicate information. This in term increases patient/family stress.

**Increased cost and provider burden.** Additional costs exist related to hospital stays from adverse events and readmissions. Additional administrative costs also exist to locate, reconcile, and coordinate information.

### 1.2 Standards

**Standards** are agreed-upon methods for connecting systems together. They may pertain to security, data transport, data format or structure, or the meanings of codes or terms. They are defined, updated, and maintained by standards development organizations (SDOs) through a collaborative process involving the audience that will be using the standards. Some examples of standards in sectors other than healthcare:

-   ISO 6 - camera film speed

-   W3C - open web platform standards (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc.)

-   IEC 60309 - sockets, plugs, and connectors

Standards also come with **challenges**, as stakeholders have both common and differing needs. Creating one standard to fit all use cases would results in large, slow systems. The only way for a standard to become effective is for everyone to adopt the same one.

[Health Level Seven (HL7®)](https://www.hl7.org/) is an ANSI-accredited SDO dedicated to providing a comprehensive framework and related standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information that supports clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of health services. Below are examples of HL7 standards for healthcare:

-   [Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA)](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/standards-technology/consolidated-cda-overview): framework for creating clinical documents that contain both human-readable text and machine-readable XML

-   [HL7® v2 Messaging](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185): commonly used data interchange standard that includes messaging specifications for patient administration, orders, results, scheduling, claims management, document management, and many others

-   [Quality Reporting Document Architecture](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Quality_Reporting_Document_Architecture): standard for communicating healthcare quality measures

-   [HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)](http://hl7.org/fhir/): specification for exchanging clinical and administrative healthcare data; based on REST, OAuth, and OpenID Connect

    -   [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/): simple authorization framework that enables a third-party application to obtain access to an HTTP service

    -   [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/): simple identity layer designed to work with OAuth 2.0

As seen above, **HL7® FHIR®** is not the first health IT standard. However, other standards have focused on specific user needs (e.g., quality measures) and have failed to achieve widespread adoption across industry. FHIR® is a new specificaiton based on emerging industry approaches, informed by years of [lessons learned](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/comparison.html) around requirements, successes, and challenges from defining and implementing previous standards. FHIR**®** aims to simplify implementation without sacrificing information integrity. It leverages existing models and ensures alignment to previously definied best practices to provide a consistent, easy to implement, and rigorous mechanism for exchanging data between healthcare applications. There is widespread adoption of base FHIR**®** Resources, with profiles tailoring them to specific use cases.

### 1.3 Regulating Interoperability

The current health IT ecosystem is characterized by proprietary systems and closed data standards. In many cases, the only way to transfer data between sources is if both parties are in the same network and use the same IT systems (e.g., same EHR vendor). Patients do not have access to their own data and providers do not have access to complete patient records. Current economic incentives are not closing this gap.

In order to address these issues and improve health outcomes, the US government (including ONC, CMS, and others) is beginning to regulate the adoption of FHIR® as a single, common, open standard.

## 2. What is FHIR?

![](images/fhir_acronym.png)

Healthcare records are increasingly becoming digitized. As patients move around the healthcare ecosystem, their electronic health records must be available, discoverables, and understandable. FHIR® is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. Standards establish a common language and process for all health IT systems to communicate, allowing information to be shared seamlessly and efficiently. FHIR® can be used as a stand-alone data exchange standard or with existing standards.

FHIR® is fast, efficient, and flexible. Its philosophy is to build a base set of reserouces that eithe rby themselves or when combined satisfy the majority of use cases. It uses the **80/20 rule**, where 20% of the requirements satisfuy 80% of the needs. Solutions are built from modular components called "Resources," which are described in detail in [3.3 Looking Closer: FHIR® Resources](#looking-closer-fhir-resources). There is also the option to develop custom extensions for a variety of use cases.

### 2.1 FHIR® Key Principles

-   Focus on **implementers**

-   Target support for **common scenarios**

-   Leverage cross-industry **web technologies**

-   Require **human readability** as base level of interoperability

-   Standard is **freely available**

-   Support multiple **paradigms and architectures**

-   Demonstrate best practice **governance**

### 2.2 Business Case: Why Promote FHIR®?

**Single standard for health care transactions.** FHIR® provides a standard for *both* administrative (claims, explanations of benefits, etc.) *and* clinical data.

**Reduced burden and operating costs.** Aligning industry on a single, common standard means that parties do not need to maintain complicated translation layers, manual processes, or numerous differing workflows for accomplishing a single task.

**Enables competition.** An open standards breaks down barriers to entry, allowing more open, free competition and lower costs.

**Empowers patients.** One standard allows developers to compile all different types of data, whithout the need for additional layers of translation, enabling patients and caregivers to access their information in one place.

**Greater data insights for healthier people**. Marrying these data sets will empower research, data science, and informatics, ultimately leading to healthier populations.

**Enables more equitable decision-making**. Access to different slices of medical data could be standardized through FHIR® to supplement socio-economic determinants of health.

### 2.3 Why Should You Understand FHIR®?

The level of FHIR® activity and adoption is increasing rapidly. FHIR® APIs are specifically required in the **ONC 21st Century Cures Act** and the **CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Rule** (implementation enforcement deadline was July 1, 2021). Federal agencies such as CMS, ONC, and CDC are increasingly looking for FHIR®-based solutions to healthcare problems. As a result, healthcare providers with access to health IT APIs using FHIR® is widespread.

### 3.2 Analogy: Baking

Using FHIR® Resources to build implementations can be compared to baking a cake. Below are key term analogies to keep in mind:

-   Implementation Guide = Recipe

-   Implementation = Cake

-   Connectathon = Test Kitchen

A **Resource** can be viewed as a cake, which is a broad template with possible characteristics such as flavor, icing, toppings, and number of tiers. A **Profile** can be viewed as the type of cake, which further constrains the general Cake Resource. And finally, and **Extension** can be viewed as additional characteristics of the cake that were not part of the original cake and cake type. Below illustrates an example of a chocolate cake:

![](images/cake_analogy_profiles.png)

An **instance** is each implementation of the Profile (each cake baked using the Chocolate Cake Recipe). You can have multiple instances using the same base FHIR® Resource with different Profile implementations. In other words, you can bake different chocolate cakes from the choices allowed in the Chocolate Cake Recipe:

![](images/cake_analogy_instances.png)

Keeping the cake analogy but with a real-world example, below shows the Prior Level of Function Profile broken down into its cake-related parts:

![](images/cake_analogy_prior_level_of_function.png)

### 3.3 Looking Closer: FHIR® Resources {#looking-closer-fhir-resources}

**Resources** are the building blocks for FHIR**®**. They act as customizable templates within a general framework. They are designed to be very flexible to provide structure to address 80% of use cases. Almost everything is optional, even critical information like name, gender, birth date, and address.

Resources by themselves are often not useful; Profiles and Extensions supplement existing Resources. Implementation Guides then add the necessary constraints to support interoperability. Developers can then use Implementation Guides to "bundle" together any combination of the 146 FHIR Resources (e.g., Patient, Diagnostic Report, Practitioner, Location) with Profiles and/or Extensions to transmit only select information from a large amount of data (e.g., an EHR).

Below is an example of what a base FHIR® Resource Specification looks like. This is the [Patient Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html) found on HL7®'s FHIR® documentation site, which is publicly available to see further information. The left-hand side shows the name of the given Resource (in this case, Patient) as well as all of its component categories underneath. This module will not dive into the technical details, but note that each category has information about potential flags, cardinality, type, and description/constraints.

![](images/base_fhir_resource_spec.png)

Below is an example of a what a FHIR® Resource looks like after its been implemented (in JSON format). Like earlier, this module will not dive into the technical details, but note the general layout and 4 major sections of a FHIR resource.

![](images/fhir_resource_json.png)

### 3.4 US FHIR® Core Profile

There is an important FHIR® Profile known as **US Core**, which profiles 23 FHIR® resources specifically for the US healthcare market. It is driven by and interacts with [United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi), which is a standardized set of health data for nationwide, interoperable health information exchange. ONC Cures Act requires as a condition of certification that EHRs adopt the USCDI standards, a "standardized API for patient and population services," which includes an initial set of 16 data classes comprised of 52 data elements. The initial US Core ball occurred in 2021 and subsequent ballots to update US Core will occur every January beginning in 2022.

### 3.5 FHIR**®** APIs

Systems need to use the same "dictionary," "language," "terminology," and "alphabet" to exchange information accurately. Computer systems need all these layers to align in order to communicate with each other. French and English share the same alphabet, but two pepole speaking different languages won't understand each other. Even British English and American English may not align on terminology. They also need to use the same "directions," i.e. protocol. If two people are going to the same address but one takes the highway and the other takes backroads, they may nto arrive at the same time.

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is software that allows two systems to talk to each other via a request/response architecture. It enables the retrieval or exchange of *only* specified information from a large amount of data.

A **FHIR® API** leverages the same standards as web browsers to specify interoperable, computable format and meaning for exchanging healthcare data between systems. It uses the the HL7® FHIR® standard with REpresentational State Transfer (REST), which is software used for Web services development. It reduces miscommunication and impediments to communication between systems by establishing a *common language* (XML/JSON) and protocol (HTTP) for how systems exchange data (i.e., directions). Using standard terminology, searchability is improved. Implementation guides serve as instructions for developers to build FHIR® APIs.

Provided below is a high-level diagram of information flow with a FHIR® API. Data originates from a FHIR® client, which can be a developer made mobile/web application or simply a database. A RESTful API then sends this data over HTTP as standardized Resources to a FHIR® server, where it is then mapped to/from the FHIR® standard and subsequently parsed out into the appropriate system. Note that this process is **bidirectional** and can happen in the opposite direction as well, with a FHIR® server aggregating data from a multitude of systems and then sending that to a client application.
