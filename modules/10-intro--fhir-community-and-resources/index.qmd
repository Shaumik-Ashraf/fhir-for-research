title: FHIR Community & Resources
---

## Key points

1.  FHIR has a very active community of users who are often willing to engage in discussion or offer advice.
2.  You can engage ad hoc on Zulip ([chat.fhir.org](https://chat.fhir.org) online chat), or discuss with an official HL7 Work Group.
3.  HL7's Confluence site has additional resources and historical information that may be useful.

## 1. The FHIR community

HL7 (<https://hl7.org>) manages both the FHIR technology, and the community of maintainers and implementers. FHIR is developed as an open source specification (found at <https://hl7.org/fhir/>), and the vast majority of HL7's work is done "in the open," where any interested person can freely join in to discuss or contribute. Additionally, many FHIR Implementation Guides also follow this "in the open" development approach. This approach makes members of the community generally fairly accessible via the mechanisms described below.

### HL7 Work Groups

HL7 specifications and many FHIR Implementation Guides are developed as HL7 projects under the guidance of one or more HL7 [Work Groups](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4489802):

> Work groups are the bodies within HL7 that take on responsibility for developing and maintaining standards. They are where the "work" of HL7 gets done. HL7 has a large number of work groups covering the spectrum of the healthcare space. All work groups are open to participation by anyone with an interest in their content.

These typically meet virtually on a weekly basis for a conference call, as well as in person (or hybrid) at [HL7 Working Group Meetings](https://www.hl7.org/events/workgroupmeetings.cfm?ref=nav) held three times per year.

HL7 Work Groups consist of volunteer subject matter experts and other stakeholders. Each Work Group has a [mailing list](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Mailing+List+Instructions) that you can join to communicate with the Work Group, including asking for time on an upcoming conference call. Work Groups also typically post conference call agendas on their Confluence sites ([see the Work Group directory for Confluence links](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4489802)).

### HL7 Projects

<!--# Brief description of the process for HL7 projects and balloting. The use case is for readers to have a basic understanding of where IGs come from and how the balloting process ensures quality. This should also briefly mention HL7 maturity levels (e.g. STU) -->

### Connectathons

<!--# What are Connectathons, why are they important, how they may related to research -->

## 2. Zulip (chat.fhir.org)

<!--# Describe what Zulip is (analogy to Slack or Teams groups), how to find the right stream if you have a question (search streams, or search all public streams for similar topics and see where they were posted), and #implementers stream to post in if you can't figure out where to ask -->

## 3. HL7 Confluence and Jira

<!--# Describe what Confluence is (Wikipedia), and Jira ("issue tracking"). Confluence is useful for finding relevant HL7 projects and Work Groups, and for documentation on the HL7/FHIR infrastructure and processes. Jira is probably only useful to this audience in the sense that it is mentioned in Confluence. -->
