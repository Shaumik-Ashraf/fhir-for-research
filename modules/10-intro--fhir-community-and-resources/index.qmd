## Introduction

FHIR has an active community of users who engage in discussions and offer advice. Discussions take place in a variety of forums.

This module will intoduce you to the HL7 and FHIR community, offer suggestions on where to ask questions, and clarify the various touchpoints and engagement opportunities.

<!--# DISCUSS

I no longer think this is necessary.

## The HL7 FHIR community

The HL7 FHIR community is comprised of developers, maintainers, and implementers that engage with the [FHIR specification](https://hl7.org/fhir/). Community-members work in a variety of environments including clinical settings, health-focused companies and non-profits, and local, state, and federal health agencies. [HL7](<https://hl7.org>) manages the [FHIR standard](https://hl7.org/fhir/), FHIR technology (e.g., [implementation guides (IGs)](http://fhir.org/guides/registry/) and the [FHIR API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html)<!--# i added link. double check to ensure it's the right one --LDC -->) and the community of maintainers and implementers. 

[FHIR](<https://hl7.org/fhir/>) is an open source specification, and the vast majority of HL7's FHIR work is done in public forums and channels. Any interested person can join in to discuss or contribute. The FHIR community also develops many of the FHIR Implementation Guides publicly. This approach makes members of the community accessible to other implementers and developers who want to follow the progress of work or ask questions via the channels described below.

### HL7 Work Groups

HL7 specifications and many FHIR Implementation Guides are developed as [HL7 Projects](http://www.hl7.org/special/Committees/projman/searchableProjectIndex.cfm?action=list). HL7 Projects include a variety of initiatives. For the purpose of this module, "HL7 Projects" refers to any efforts, including IGs, that are developed under the guidance of one or more [HL7 Work Groups](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4489802). 

> Work groups are the bodies within HL7 that take on responsibility for developing and maintaining standards. They are where the "work" of HL7 gets done. HL7 has a large number of work groups covering the spectrum of the healthcare space. All work groups are open to participation by anyone with an interest in their content.

Each Work Group lists the [projects under their umbrella](http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/index.cfm?ref=nav).

Work Groups typically meet on a weekly basis for a [conference call](http://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDirectory.aspx), as well as in-person (or hybrid) at [HL7 Working Group Meetings](https://www.hl7.org/events/workgroupmeetings.cfm?ref=nav), which are held three times per year.

HL7 Work Groups consist of subject matter experts and other stakeholders. Each Work Group has a [mailing list](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Mailing+List+Instructions) that you can join to communicate with the Work Group, including asking for time on an upcoming conference call. Work Groups also typically post conference call agendas on their Confluence sites (see the [Work Group directory](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4489802) for Confluence links).

#### Getting started

The fastest way to get started is to join a regular [conference call](http://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDirectory.aspx) and ask to introduce yourself. There is a core leadership team for each Work Group that facilitates meetings. Attendees vary depending on agenda content.

Alternatively (or additionally), join the Work Group's [mailing list](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Mailing+List+Instructions) and reach out to the group's leadership to introduce yourself. The mailing list is also used to request items be added to a future agenda. 

#### Tips for attending Work Group meetings:

- Get specific questions addressed by asking to be on the agenda ahead of the meeting.

- Be prepared to discuss your agenda item(s). Agendas are available ahead of the meeting on the Work Group's Confluence page.

- Share your expertise. Contributions to the Work Group ensure that new projects and specifications can be implemented and used by the community. That requires input from a variety of stakeholders.

### HL7 Projects
<!--# Brief description of the process for HL7 projects and balloting. The use case is for readers to have a basic understanding of where IGs come from and how the balloting process ensures quality. This should also briefly mention HL7 maturity levels (e.g. STU) -->

<!--# DISCUSS
I think this section should be removed entirely.
I expect Max will need to make that decision. I think it's good info but doesn't belong in this module. I think the previous section does a good job providing an introduction to HL7 projects.
--LDC
-->

Every HL7 project is sponsored by one of the Work Groups. The sponsorship ensures that stakeholders can offer input during the early stages of the standards development process and that each specification is developed with consideration of other existing or developing standards.

All HL7 projects also go through the [balloting process](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/HL7+Balloting). For a given period of time, any reviewer affiliated with HL7 (and occasionally those outside of HL7) can submit comments and suggestions for edits. All issues and comments must be reviewed by the authors of the specification and the sponsoring Work Group before it can move to the next stage in the balloting process. At each stage of the balloting process, a vote is held to determine if the specification is ready for the next phase of development or publication.

There are four ballot levels:

-   **For Comment**: Generally a feedback solicitation stage for the early steps of specification development.
-   **Informative**: Used to review content that is not binding for implementers.
    -   This level is often used for internal HL7 processes or publishing guidance (not requirements) for the implementer community.
-   **Standard for Trial Use (STU)**: Used for binding content that is deemed "ready to implement" by the Work Group, but lacks extensive implementation by FHIR community.
-   **Normative**: This level is reserved for the final review of a specification.
    -   It can require several cycles of feedback, edits, and voting, but once balloters and the Work Group approve, the specification can be published and considered to be an authoritative standard.
    -   Content in this stage is considered to be stable and any subsequent changes should be minor fixes that will not negatively impact existing implementations of the specification.

Every HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide includes a version history that lists the version of the guide, FHIR version used, date published, and often a description of the changes made in that version. This information can be useful for seeing historical, current, and work-in-progress versions that are being balloted.

![The version history for the US Core FHIR IG showing the current version of the IG to be 5.0.1 and STU6 work in progress IG, 6.0.0](images/version-history-us-core.png)

The version history can be accessed at the very bottom of the Implementation Guide.

![The meta data for the US Core FHIR IG, at the bottom of the IG's page, includes a link to the Version History information above.](images/version-history-meta-data-us-core.png)


### Zulip (chat.fhir.org)

<!--# Describe what Zulip is (analogy to Slack or Teams groups), how to find the right stream if you have a question (search streams, or search all public streams for similar topics and see where they were posted), and #implementers stream to post in if you can't figure out where to ask -->

<!--# DISCUSS
I moved this to the FHIR community section

--LDC
-->

Zulip ([chat.fhir.org](https://chat.fhir.org)) is an asynchronous communication platform, similar to Slack or Teams messaging. Anyone is welcome to join and it can be an valuable tool for asking questions and connecting with others that have similar objectives for health data. 

Zulip has Streams (like Channels on Slack) for topics like Implementation Guide development, Terminology, and Cancer Interoperability. Users then post comments or questions inside the Stream for others to respond. Streams can be found by searching for specific topics or browsing through the list. Searching all Streams or narrowing a search to a certain Stream in the search bar is helpful for troubleshooting common problems or seeing if anyone else has asked the same question before.

#### Getting started

Before using Zulip, review HL7's [community expectations](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Chat.fhir.org+Community+Expectations). 

If you have a question and don't know which Stream to post it in, [#implementers](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers) Stream is a good place to start. 

Other useful Streams to subscribe to include:

- [#Announcements](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179240-Announcements): posts with new Streams, releases of new versions of specifications, and ballot updates

- [#implementers](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers): discussion about implementing FHIR resources

- [#analytics on FHIR](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179219-analytics-on-FHIR): useful for those using FHIR interfaces and APIs for data analytics

- [#social](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179160-social): general discussion about the FHIR community with the occasional fun update from a community member



### Connectathons

<!--# What are Connectathons, why are they important, how they may related to research -->

[Connectathons](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Connectathons) are an opportunity for contributors and community members to engage synchronously for discussions and interoperability testing. HL7 describes [Connectathons](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Connectathons) as:<!--# Added link again here to make it obvious where the quote below was coming from. I felt the earlier link was too far away from the direct quote. --LDC -->

> ...an event that is centered on developing the HL7 FHIR Specification including resources, profiles and implementation guides. The purpose of a Connectathon is to prove that the specification is complete and facilitate FHIR implementation guide maturity.

Three Connectathons are held each year in both in-person and virtual formats. Anyone can [attend as a participant](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Connectathons)<!--# DISCUSS: I don't see a better evergreen participant page for Connectathons but the most recent or next Connectathon is linked there --KMB --><!--# looks good to me --LDC --> or submit a proposal to be a [Track Lead](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Connectathon+Track+Lead+Responsibilities). Connectathon Track Leads share their specification or resource for implementers to test drive and offer feedback. A complete list of the Tracks is posted before the Connectathon, and offerings from [previous Connectathons](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Previous+Connectathons) can be browsed as well. 


#### Getting started
<!--# DISCUSS
I added "Getting started" sections to each community section. I mostly moved existing content into them, but added a fair bit to this one. Please review.

--LDC
-->
If you'd like to attend a Connectathon, you can find information about the upcoming Connectathons on [HL7's Connectathon events page](https://www.hl7.org/events/fhir-connectathon/) or the [Connectathon Confluence page](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Connectathons).

The [Connectathon FAQs](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/HL7+FHIR+Connectathon+FAQs) provide information on requirements to participate. 

First time attendees must watch the [FHIR Training for Beginners Newcomer Orientation](https://vimeo.com/542197402/8fb80fea04).

Each Connectathon hosts a virtual Participant Information Session several weeks ahead of the Connectathon event. The Participant Information Session includes information about what Tracks are available, how to connect with Track Leads, and how to prepare your sandbox system.

## HL7 FHIR resources

### HL7 Confluence

<!--# Describe what Confluence is (Wikipedia), and Jira ("issue tracking"). Confluence is useful for finding relevant HL7 projects and Work Groups, and for documentation on the HL7/FHIR infrastructure and processes. Jira is probably only useful to this audience in the sense that it is mentioned in Confluence. -->

Documentation on HL7 processes and general information is typically found in the [HL7 Confluence](https://confluence.hl7.org) site. Confluence is a Wikipedia-like encyclopedia for HL7. Many of the links throughout this module go to HL7 Confluence pages. The site is useful for finding:

-   relevant HL7 projects in development
-   schedules and information for HL7 Work Groups
-   processes and documentation on HL7 and FHIR infrastructure

The Confluence site also includes tips on [getting involved](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Getting+Involved) and [implementor support](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Implementer+Support).

### HL7 Jira

Project work and specification development primarily occurs in [HL7 Jira](https://jira.hl7.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa). The site is an issue-tracking resource used for managing comments and suggestions on HL7 specifications and terminologies. 

<!--

### FHIR Community Forum

Discussion about FHIR Implementation and Development Topics occurs in the [FHIR Community Forum](http://community.fhir.org/). The [FHIR Community Forum](http://community.fhir.org/t/welcome-to-the-fhir-community-forum/8) is a place to ask questions like 

> - How do I do [x]? where [x] is any kind of use of FHIR at all
> - Has anyone solved [my problem] with the specification? (or is anyone interested in this)
> - Why does FHIR work like it does?
> - What does everyone think about [making some change to the FHIR specification]?

Although the FHIR Community Forum is monitored, Zulip ([chat.fhir.org](https://chat.fhir.org)) is more active.

### FHIR Test Servers
<!--# DISCUSS
I'm not sure if this belongs here or not...

--LDC
-->

Multiple [FHIR test servers](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Public+Test+Servers) are available for testing FHIR implementations.

> These are public services provided by volunteers and HL7 makes no representations concerning their safety or reliability.


### StackOverflow on FHIR
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a forum for asking and answering technical questions. Use the [hl7-fhir tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hl7_fhir) for developer and programming questions about reference FHIR implementations.
